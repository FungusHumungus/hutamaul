== HutaMaul

Hutamaul is a simple html parser that will then split the html according to a given character count. It then churns out valid html, closing any tags that were discarded during the split.

To use:

html = "<div>some interesting text<span>and then something ok</span>bit more</div>"


# This will split the html at the closest word break to 25 characters.
split_html = Hutamaul.split(html, 25);

# This will split the html at the closes word break to 22 characters and add a ... to the end
split_html = Hutamaul.split(html, 25, '...') 

# Further options can be set on a tag by tag basis.
split_html = Hutamaul.split(html, 25, '...') do |options|

	# Text within a <code> tag gets split before the current line
	options.code { |split| split.before_line }

	# All other text will get split at the requested character.
	options.else { |split| split.at_character }
end
